Supply Chain Management:-
A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants tooptimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.
